Useful in places, but half of it contradicts theother half. If you want to know what they were really like, I hope you’ve got better sources than me.", "A fair amount.

initial_dialog = "Spiritkeeper. Welcome to Clayport. I am Elder Reedwhisper, though most just call me Reed. I’ve heard a little about you, but I prefer to form my own impressions. You’ve come at a busy time, but then… it’s always a busy time somewhere.
Hello! What’s happening here?
Oh, the usual. Things always need doing. We go at our own pace though. If you’re inclined		to help, you’ll find your place soon enough. And if you’re not inclined… well, the market has fine food, at least.
Do you think I can help, then?
I think anyone can be of help, if they choose to be. The question is whether they’re willing to put in the effort when no one’s looking. Of course, you’re the Spiritkeeper, so I imagine you’re here to do more than sit by the water
all day. Tempting as that is."
