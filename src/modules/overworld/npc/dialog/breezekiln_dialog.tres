Nice to meet you. What’s happening here?
Repairs. Maintenance. Same thing every day. Something breaks, I fix it. Lately, it’s been more breakin’ than fixin’.
Do you need my help?
Yeah. Don’t expect me to roll out a welcome mat, but I can’t do it all myself no more. If you’re stickin’ around, make yourself useful. You’ll figure where you fit. If you pull your weight, I’ll make it worth your while.
