This book was passed to me by the last Spiritkeeper, something to help ease the weight of this role. So far, I know only this: rare people are \"touched by essence\". We can commune with the spirits where others cannot.
But... am I not supposed to be able to hear them speak?
The last Spiritkeeper looked at me strange when I told him. He said he never could and that worries me. I don't know if something's wrong with me or if it's something the world deemed necessary for me to know?
But if this gift helps me understand the spirits betterâ€¦ maybe it's what Reach needs now.
