I can no longer hear the gods songs. Maybe they are resting or went into hiding? The temples they have built still stand, but they do so in silence now. 

Without their guidance, the spirits has begun to act differently. As if they no longer knows their way. The people here seem to notice too, they have begun to whisper among themselves. 

I hope the gods wake up soon.
