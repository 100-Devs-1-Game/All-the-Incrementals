text = "The Gods’ Departure
Solvar and Vandr are gone. No farewell. No sign. Only silence where their presence once sang through the skies.

There was a time when the gods walked beside us. They shaped the land, stirred the winds, and breathed balance into every corner of this world. I used to hear their song in the breeze… but now, the wind carries nothing.
Their shrine still stands, but they grow weaker with each passing day.

So I write this for the next of kin. I will watch over their land, as will you. In case they ever return.

 — Spiritkeeper Tellen, Second in the Line"
