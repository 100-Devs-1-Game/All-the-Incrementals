I saw a spirit I didn’t recognize today. The others say I should be wary, but I don’t think it means harm. It seemed… lost, more than anything. Drawn to the essence like a moth to light. Especially the larger sources. Maybe it brings them comfort, now that the gods departed.

They play tricks more often now, mischievous little things. Harmless, mostly. But the villagers are growing tired of them, restless and some even fearful. Have they forgotten how helpful they are?

I get the feeling my role as a spiritkeeper is about to grow more complicated.
